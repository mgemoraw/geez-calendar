    Checks if an Ethiopian year is a leap year.

    The Ethiopian calendar has a simple leap year rule: every year that is
    divisible by 4 in the *Ethiopian* cycle (not the Gregorian one) is a leap year.
    However, the cycle is based on the year's position within a 4-year cycle.
    The rule is that a year is a leap year if the year number modulo 4 equals 3.
    This is equivalent to `(year + 1) % 4 == 0` for a simple 4-year cycle.
    However, the correct calculation is based on the `(year % 4 == 3)` for the
    years since the epoch. The simple way to handle this is `(year + 1) % 4 == 0`.
    A more robust rule is `(year % 4) == 3` if the year started counting from
    a year 1 that was the first year of the 4-year cycle.
    For simplicity, let's use the standard `(year + 1) % 4 == 0`.
    
    A more accurate check is if the year is a "Year of Luke" or `Lukas`.
    The years of the cycle are named after the four evangelists: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
    A leap year occurs in the Year of Luke. The Year of Luke is the 4th year of the cycle.
    A common year is a leap year in the Ethiopian calendar if `(year + 1) % 4 == 0`.
    For example, 2015 E.C. is a leap year because (2015 + 1) % 4 = 0.
